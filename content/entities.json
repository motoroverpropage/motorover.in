        "Kyrgyzstan is one of the best-kept secrets of Central Asia. It is a magical land of snowcapped mountains that disappear into the clouds, alpine lakes with turquoise water, stunning gorges, glacial rivers and vast swathes of velvety grasslands dotted with wild horses and cattle grazing peacefully.Located to the north of India, Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country but has the world’s second largest alpine lake, the Issyk-Kul.Motorover’s weeklong, guided motorcycle tour of the Silk Route in Kyrgyzstan starts and ends in the country’s bustling capital, Bishkek. There will be a MotoRover tour manager on the lead bike and the group will be followed by the sweep car that carries your luggage and has a mechanic and first-aid kit on board to ensure that you get the support required to explore this foreign land.All the paved roads on this tour were part of the ancient silk route that was used for transporting silk and spices from China to the European continent. However, the real beauty of Kyrgyzstan reveals itself only when you venture off-road. Our route has a mix of paved and dirt road riding that takes you through breath-taking landscapes and mountain passes.That’s not all, carefully selected sights like the Tash Rabat caravanserai and cultural experiences like the traditional horse games, eagle hunting, lunch in a yurt (traditional Central Asian round tent) and the folklore show will give you an enriching insight into the nomadic lifestyle of the Kyrgyz.",

        "Flanked by Russia to the east and the Baltic Sea to the west, the ‘Baltic States’ of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in northern Europe are an enchanting land of untouched forests, endless beaches and medieval castles. Their long Soviet past has left indelible impressions in the form of Stalinist architecture and the occasional Lada cars zooming around, while the old towns of Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius exude the typical European charm – cobbled streets, cosy cafes and UNESCO World Heritage Sites.This weeklong tour across three countries starts in Tallinn (Estonia) and ends in Vilnius (Lithuania). A MotoRover tour manager will lead the ride on a motorcycle and a sweep car will follow the riders to ensure no one is left behind and to carry the group’s luggage. Our route has a good mix of wide open highways where you can revel in flat out riding while the carefully chosen winding countryside roads offer stunning rural landscapes of fields, blue skies, lakes and Baroque architecture. Riding will be on paved roads and there are four different options of touring bikes to choose from.The northern Europe motorcycle tour balances out the riding and free time for you to enjoy riding along the Baltic Sea and indulging in Soviet era experiences. Hotels are centrally located in big cities where you can take a walking tour of the beautiful old towns and shop for Baltic amber. Ride with us this August to explore the forgotten part of the European continent."

        "Morocco is the gateway to Saharan Africa. An exotic land with a unique mix of Arabic, French and Berber cultures that can be traced back to the country’s colonial past and its geographical location on the north-western tip of Africa. It is one of the safest countries on the continent and Moroccans are friendly and hospitable towards tourists.Along with its cultural diversity, Morocco is also known for its cuisine, art and ever-changing landscapes, which makes it an exciting country to explore on a motorcycle! Morocco first appeared on MotoRover’s tour calendar in 2019 and we have already completed seven successful road trips in the country with over 100 travellers!The 2026 edition is a 9 day motorcycle tour starting and ending in the biggest city of Morocco, Casablanca. The entire riding route is on paved roads and we are offering BMW and Husqvarna adventure touring rental motorcycle options for the ride. Contrary to the stereotype, Morocco is not just about the Sahara desert. It has vast mountain ranges spread across the length of the country and the entire northern and eastern border of Morocco is a coastline. Our route offers a good mix of terrain and landscapes as it covers the High Atlas and Middle Atlas mountains, the Sahara desert and the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Apart from the ride, we have plenty of sightseeing and activities on the tour including a break day in the Imperial city of Marrakech. Shop for local artefacts in the famous souqs of Marrakech, walk through narrow alleys of the fortified Medina (old town) and experience a sensory overload in Jemaa el Fna, the vibrant central square.A MotoRover guide will lead the tour on a motorcycle followed by the participating riders and the group will be followed by a support van that carries tools, a mechanic, a second MotoRover guide and your luggage. We have designed this tour after a thorough on-ground exploration of Morocco to give you a refined experience. The terrain is enjoyable for amateurs as well as experienced riders and the daily riding distance has been calculated to provide you with ample breaks and photo opportunities.Group size will be limited to 12 riders and apart from the motorcycles and support team, the tour package includes airport pickup/drop, breakfasts and dinners (veg/non-veg) and the accommodation will be in boutique hotels, Riads and luxury tent camps in the Sahara! All you have to do is arrive and ride.",

It is a land blessed with natural beauty and a great variety of features like mountains, glaciers, rivers, tropical forests, and a long coastline, since it is an island nation.It is known as the ‘Land Of The Long White Cloud’ due to its shape as seen from the sky and its Māori name (Māori were the first inhabitants of the islands before British colonization) is Aotearoa. It is an isolated archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean with two major landmasses, the North Island and the South Island. The southern island is bigger and more beautiful and that is where we conduct our motorcycle tour of New Zealand.Although an independent country since the year 1947, New Zealand has a British way of life. The ‘Kiwis’ as they are called, speak English, eat English, drive on the left side of the road and allow riding based on a Indian driving license, which makes it very easy to go around.Our motorcycle tour of New Zealand is a 9 day/8-night guided road trip starting and ending in the biggest city on the South Island, Christchurch. The tour will be led by a guide on a motorcycle and the participant bikes will be followed by luggage van. Besides the riding, the tour package also takes care of other travel requirements like accommodation, meals, airport transfers and local experiences.Join us for an epic adventure down under to end the year on a high!"
